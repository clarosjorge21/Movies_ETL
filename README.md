# Movies_ETL

### Purpose
Today we are here to help Britta create an automated pipeline that not only takes in new data but performs appropriate transformations and loads data into existing tables. By refactoring the code we have already worked with we are able to perform the ETL process and add the data to a PostgreSQL database.
